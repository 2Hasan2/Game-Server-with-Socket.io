# Real-Time Multiplayer Game Server with Socket.io

This Node.js server code is designed to create a real-time multiplayer game using Socket.io, enabling communication between server and clients. The server handles player connections, disconnections, and updates player positions in a simple game environment.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- Express
- Socket.io

## Setup and Usage

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone <repository-url>`
2. **Install dependencies:** Run `npm install` to install the necessary packages.
3. **Run the server:** Execute `node app.js` or the file name you've used. 
**Use nodemon:** If you have nodemon installed, you can run `nodemon app.js` to automatically restart the server when changes are made to the code.
4. **Open the client:** Open `http://localhost:5500` in your browser to run the client.


Make sure you've set up the environment correctly and understand the basics of Node.js, Express, and Socket.io.

## Server Code Overview

The server code (`app.js` or equivalent file) includes:

- Initializing an Express app on port 5500.
- Serving static files from the 'client' directory using Express's `express.static` middleware.
- Handling invalid routes with an error message.
- Creating a Socket.io instance on the server.

Additionally, it manages a simple multiplayer game with features like:

- Creating player objects and assigning colors upon connection.
- Handling player connection and disconnection.
- Updating player positions and broadcasting the updates to all connected clients.

Please ensure you've gone through the code to understand the game logic and Socket.io event handling for the best usage and customization.
